Subject: Minos Pizza - Demo Account Ready

Hi Rohan,

Great speaking with you this morning after you saw our Instagram ad. As promised, here's a quick email with some further details on Pumpd. We've set up a demo account for you so you and Ahan can get an idea of how your ordering page would look. You can access the ordering page here: https://minospizza.pumpd.co.nz (It's just on our domain while it's a demo account).

As discussed, the 34.5% commission that UberEats takes makes it incredibly difficult to maintain healthy profit margins on delivery orders. You've been using Gloria Foods for pickup orders, but as you mentioned, not being able to offer delivery through that system limits its effectiveness - plus that long, messy URL doesn't exactly help with marketing.

We're helping to solve this exact problem by cutting the commission fees on delivery orders down to just 5% through our integration with the Uber driver network, and just 2% on pickup orders. With our software and pricing model, your customers actually save money when ordering directly from your website (since you won't need to mark up menu prices), while your profit margins look significantly better at the same time. Our reporting dashboard shows that similar restaurants like Base Pizza in Christchurch are saving thousands per year with this approach.

You mentioned having a large customer database that isn't being utilized effectively right now. With our SMS marketing system, we'll be able to help you leverage that database to promote deals, encourage repeat orders through our loyalty program, and ultimately drive more direct orders to your website.

The timing works out perfectly with your expansion plans too - the same system can handle Rombus Cafe and your upcoming Base Camp Momo ghost kitchen, making it easy to manage multiple brands from one dashboard.

If Monday at 2pm still works for you and Ahan, I'd love to jump on a Zoom call to show you exactly how everything works. During that demo, I'll walk you through the customer ordering experience, show you the backend management system, and demonstrate the real-time reporting that shows your savings on every order. Just let me know if that time works or if another time would be better.

Looking forward to showing you both how we can make your businesses significantly more profitable.

Best,
Gianni
