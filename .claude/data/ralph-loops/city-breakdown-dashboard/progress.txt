## Completed
- Feature 1: Dialog state management (Iteration 1)
  - Added useState for createJobOpen and prefillScrapeData
  - Created handleStartScrape callback
  - Imported and rendered CreateLeadScrapeJob dialog
  - Build passes successfully

- Feature 2: CityBreakdownTab renders on Dashboard (Iteration 2)
  - Imported CityBreakdownTab from @/components/reports/CityBreakdownTab
  - Added Card wrapper with brand-purple title
  - Placed between Recent Activity grid and Quick Actions card
  - Passed filters={{}} and onStartScrape={handleStartScrape} props
  - Build passes (4.72s), browser verification shows table with city data

- Feature 3: Expandable city rows work correctly (Iteration 3)
  - Click city row expands to show cuisines with page indicators
  - Page indicators numbered 1-10, green=scraped, gray=unscraped
  - Expand All/Collapse All buttons work correctly

- Feature 4: Clickable lead counts route correctly (Iteration 4)
  - Clicking city-level leads (e.g., Auckland 115) opens /leads?tab=pending&city=Auckland
  - Clicking cuisine-level leads (e.g., burger 47) opens /leads?tab=pending&city=Auckland&cuisine=burger
  - All tabs show correctly filtered data

- Feature 5: Empty cuisine buttons trigger dialog (Iteration 5)
  - Fixed handleStartScrape callback signature mismatch
  - CityBreakdownTab passes positional args (city, cuisine, pageOffset)
  - Dashboard was expecting object destructuring { city, cuisine, pageOffset }
  - Changed to positional: (city, cuisine, pageOffset) => setPrefillScrapeData({ city, cuisine, pageOffset })
  - Verified: BBQ for Auckland -> dialog shows City=Auckland, Cuisine=BBQ
  - Verified: Mexican for Wellington -> dialog shows City=Wellington, Cuisine=Mexican Food

  - No code changes required - verification only
  - Clicked "Burger: 4 pages scraped - Click to view leads" button for Auckland
  - New tab opens to /leads?city=Auckland&cuisine=burger
  - Filters correctly applied (Auckland + Burger)
  - Pending Leads tab shows 4 leads matching the filter

- Feature 7: Page indicators work correctly (Iteration 7)
  - No code changes required - verification only
  - Tested scraped page indicator: clicked green page 3 for burger/Auckland
  - New tab opens to /leads/db548503-2564-4ce0-90c7-00bef9cc5527 (job detail)
  - Job shows: ubereats - burger - auckland with Page offset: 3
  - Tested unscraped page indicator: clicked gray page 7 for burger/Auckland
  - Dialog opens prefilled with City=Auckland, Cuisine=Burgers, Page Offset=7
