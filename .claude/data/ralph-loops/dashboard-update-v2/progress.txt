## Current Blocker
(none)

## Last Verification Result
Feature 9: Build passes. Updated Quick Actions section - moved to top of Dashboard (after page header, before main content grid). Imported CreateTaskModal and ClipboardList icon. Added state const [createTaskModalOpen, setCreateTaskModalOpen] = useState(false). Replaced "View Analytics" button with "New Task" button that opens CreateTaskModal dialog. Modal wired with open={createTaskModalOpen}, onClose and onSuccess handlers that close the modal. Quick Actions now has 3 buttons: "New Extraction" (primary gradient), "Manage Restaurants", and "New Task" (both secondary style). CreateTaskModal placed at end of Dashboard JSX before closing div. Dialog will show restaurant dropdown selector since no restaurantId prop provided.

## Next Session Instructions
Begin implementation with Feature 10: Fix Recent Restaurants component to work consistently
