    "Please investigate the data that is retrieved when users first click onto the restaurants page. I believe it is trying to get all information from all restaurants which is making the load time very slow. We only need to be getting the data required for display on the initial table and can get the full data for each restaurant one by one when they are clicked into on the RestaurantDetail Page. The api endpoint is GET http://localhost:5007/api/restaurants. Do not change any code yet just investigate as thoroughly as possible to plan a solution. Think Hard\n",
    "Please begin by creating the new function in database-service.js",
    "Okay great, another issue with loading speeds is the base64 encoded images we extract for various logo formats are stored in the database without being converted. We already need to convert them into png images before uploading them so we might as well convert them into pngs before storage aswell. I'm concerned that if we convert them to pngs it may break the processing of them and other features that expect them to be base64 images for so we need to begin with a comprehensive investigation of the extraction, storage, retrieval, processing and uploading of logo images.\nI need you to investigate how images are extracted, processed and stored from the initial Logo Extraction features:\n/api/website-extraction/logo\n/api/website-extraction/logo-candidates\n/api/website-extraction/process-selected-logo\nI need you to investigate how they're processed into our required formats\nI need you to investigate how they're displayed in the RestaurantDetail page\nI need you to investigate how we're currently converting them temporarily for upload in the processes at this endpoint:\n/api/registration/configure-website\\\n\\\nPlease investigate thoroughly and report your findings back to me before making any changes. Think Hard"
