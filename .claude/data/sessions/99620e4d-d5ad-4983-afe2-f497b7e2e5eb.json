    "Hi",
    "Please ensure that there are no processes running on ports 3007 or 5007, then restart the server using npm start",
    "The system tried to use the admin password and email for the user account instead of the information from the form input",
    "The form on the frontend should auto populate with the name and email from the database restaurants table using the columns contact_name and contact_email [Image #1] ",
    "This system is now working but the organisation name is being added as the organisation of the user on the extractor app which isn't correct for the actual restaurant so it should be left blank",
    "I notice this is also trying to get the stripe connect url from the pumpd_accounts table but it's actually supposed to come from the restaurants table",
    "Now we need to add all of the new api endpoints from this automation project to the bottom of server.js to log them on startup. There are many endpoints we've not added to the logs ",
    "I think you might have missed some of the new routes:\\\n/api/registration/generate-code-injections\\\n/api/registration/configure-website"
