    "Okay great, the next issue we need to solve is that the navigation between individual extractions and menus to the RestaurantDetail page for a specific restaurant is difficult. So is getting to the \"show all menus\" page at \"http://localhost:5007/menus?restaurant=e238f868-97ce-4441-9e56-505ad65bd8a2\".\\\nWhen a user wants to go from editing a menu or extraction to the ResturantDetail page they currently need to go to the restaurants page which displays all restaurants and locate the restaurant they are trying to work with and then click into the view button for that restaurant. When they want to view all menus for the restaurant they need to go to the restaurants page list and click the view menus button.\nWe need to investigate and plan a frontend feature to add better navigation to various pages to enable more intuitive navigation for users.\\\n\\\n# Requirements by page:\\\n## Menus Page (List view of all restaurant menus):\\\n- Make restaurant names in the list view clickable to go to the RestaurantDetail page for that restaurant\\\n- Reroute the view menu button to the view of all menus for that restaurant (The edit button and view button currently route to the same MenuDetail page so one is redundant): E.g., \"http://localhost:5007/menus?restaurant=e238f868-97ce-4441-9e56-505ad65bd8a2\"\\\n\\\n## MenuDetails page (viewing/editing a specific menu):\\\n- Buttons for \"Manage Restaurant\" and \"View all menus\" inside the top card [Image #1]\\\n- \"Manage Restaurant\" should route to the RestaurantDetail page for that restaurant. E.g., \"http://localhost:5007/restaurants/e238f868-97ce-4441-9e56-505ad65bd8a2\"\\\n- \"View all menus\" button should route to the view of all menus for that restaurant. E.g., \"http://localhost:5007/menus?restaurant=e238f868-97ce-4441-9e56-505ad65bd8a2\"\\\n\\\n## Extraction Page (List View of all extractions):\\\n- Make restaurant names in the list view clickable to go to the RestaurantDetail page for that restaurant\\\n- Reroute View button to MenuDetails page for that menu (preparation to depreciate the ExtractionDetail page)\n\\\n## RestaurantDetails page:\\\n- Workflow tab currently displays the menus for that restaurant but the user must click the \"View all menus\" button to show the menus for that restaurant and currently has no option to view a specific menu by clicking on it. [Image #2] We need to add buttons to each menu so that the user can execute the onboarding steps directly from the RestaurantDetails page instead of having to navigate back to the MenuDetail page first. We need three buttons for each menu displayed on the Workflow tab:\\\n1. View Menu - Routes to the MenuDetails page so that the user can immediately navigate to the editing of the menu\\\n2. Upload images to cdn\\\n3. Download csv with cdn images\\\n\\\nI need you to begin by documenting the requirements in a new planning document in the @planning/database-plans/account-automation-plans/ folder\\\nThen I need you to investigate each of the requirements completely to plan out how we can implment each one using existing components. Most of the requirements can use existing functions and services for the actual execution but we still need to investigate them all to see how we are best to implement the routing and passing of data between components.\\\nStep 1: Document requirements\\\nStep 2: Think hard and investigate fully before making any code edits\\\nStep 3: Report your findings to me and await further instruction before applying the edits ",
    "Yes please start with phase 1",
    "Okay great stuff, this all works. Now please begin phase 2",
    "The manage restaurant and view all menus buttons aren't working for some reason:\\\nRequest URL\nhttp://localhost:5007/api/restaurants/undefined/details\nRequest Method\nGET\nStatus Code\n404 Not Found\\\n{\n    \"success\": false,\n    \"error\": \"Restaurant not found\"\n}\\\nRequest URL\nhttp://localhost:5007/api/menus?restaurant=undefined\nRequest Method\nGET\nStatus Code\n200 OK\\\nrestaurant undefined\\\n{\n    \"success\": true,\n    \"restaurant\": null,\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"menus\": []\n}",
    "Okay great yes now proceed to phase 3",
    "Very nice work now can you make the restaurant name on the restaurants page also clickable to view the RestaurantDetail page",
    "Now can you remove the icons next to the Restaurant name, Date Created, Last Updated and version on the menus page [Image #1] ",
    "Great now can you do the same on the restaurants page, remove the icons next to the restaurant names and last scraped dates but leave the icons in the lead contact column [Image #1]",
    "Now I need you to investigate how the extraction detail page is loaded once an extraction is fully completed, returned and processed from firecrawl. The extraction detail page is essentially a duplicate of the menu detail page and is thus redundant. It makes making changes more difficult as we have to maintain twice the code. The ideal end result of this investigation would be to make the extractions reroute to MenuDetail once the extraction completes but I need you to fully investigate this before making any changes."
