# Step 4 - NZ Companies Register Search - Decision

## Status: MANUAL PROCESS

### Rationale for Manual Handling

1. **Accuracy Challenges**
   - Restaurant names in lead forms often don't match legal entity names
   - Multiple businesses may have similar names
   - Franchises vs independent operators confusion
   - Trading names vs registered company names

2. **Not Critical for Initial Workflow**
   - NZBN and legal entity info only needed after prospect signs up
   - Can be collected during onboarding process
   - Not required for initial demo or trial setup

3. **Legal Implications**
   - Incorrect company association could have legal consequences
   - Manual verification ensures correct entity is identified
   - Important for contracts and payment processing

### When This Information Is Needed
- After prospect agrees to sign up
- Before creating legal agreements
- For payment processing setup
- For tax and compliance purposes

### Manual Process (When Required)
1. Visit https://companies-register.companiesoffice.govt.nz/
2. Search using variations of business name
3. Verify address matches Google Business Profile
4. Extract:
   - NZBN (New Zealand Business Number)
   - Legal business name
   - Director(s) information
   - Registration date

### Impact on Automation Workflow
- No impact on initial lead processing
- Parallel tasks (Steps 1, 2, 5) can proceed without this data
- Reduces complexity and error potential in automated flow
