# About the job
* Company: xGrowth
* Role: GTM Engineer (Agency) — ABM & AI
* Location: Remote (APAC time zones preferred; must overlap reliably with Australian business hours)
* Type: Full-time

## Why this role exists

xGrowth runs ABM programs for mid-market and enterprise tech across APJ and work with some of the largest tech companies like Shopify, Square, Twilio and Zoom. We need a technical operator who turns ICPs into sales-ready account and contact lists, builds account-intel automations, and prototypes AI tools that speed internal work and evolve into client offerings.

# Outcomes you’ll own (first 90 days)

## Reusable Clay recipes for ABM list building
* Ship a library of 3–4 recipes (Tiered ABM, Expansion, Competitive Takeout, Event-Triggered).

## Account-intel automation
* Stand up an automation that aggregates signals (news, hiring, tech shifts, leadership moves) into a one-page brief per account.
* Targets: ≥30% reduction in strategist research time; versioned prompts + test cases.

# What you’ll do
* Build and iterate Clay workflows: filters, multi-source enrichment, de-duplication, QA, and exports (to CSV/CRM/engagement tools).
* Create account-intel packs at scale using public data and LLM-assisted research with deterministic checks.
* Orchestrate light automations across our data sources and spreadsheets; maintain clean schemas and change logs.
* Collaborate with strategists/SDRs to refine ICPs, buying-group definitions and list acceptance criteria.
* Write crisp documentation: SOPs, runbooks, diagrams, post-mortems.

# Must-haves
* 1–3 years in Marketing Ops / RevOps / technical growth or similar.
* Hands-on Clay experience (real recipes, enrichment, exports).
* Very comfortable working with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI/Claude). You already use them for research, summarisation and QA, and you’re keen to go deeper (prompt patterns, structured outputs, basic API usage).
* Strong data hygiene mindset (normalisation, dedupe, validation, sampling).
* Clear written communication; concise documentation; bias to automate and measure.

# Nice-to-haves
* Basic SQL and light Python for transformations.
* Understanding of email/domain hygiene and sending safety rails.
* APJ market nuance (ANZ/SG/JP).

# Who thrives in this role
* Marketing Ops / RevOps analysts who became “the list person” and want more ownership.
* SDRs with strong ops chops who automated their desk and built repeatable list engines.
* Agency generalists who picked up Clay and now think in systems (ICP → accounts → buying group → enrichment → QA → export).

# How we work
* Remote-first. APAC location is ideal, but the key requirement is reliable overlap with Australian working hours for collaboration.
* High autonomy, blunt feedback, fast iteration.
* Values: Results Bias, Extreme Ownership, 1% Better, Care & Candour, Sunny Vibes.
