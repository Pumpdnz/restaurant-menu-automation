## Professional Summary

GTM-focused technical operator who built list-building automations, account-intel systems, and AI-powered workflows from scratch. As a solo founder, I automated my entire prospecting desk: ICP definition → account scraping → contact enrichment → buying-group identification → QA → CRM export. Achieved 67% outreach-to-demo conversion through systematic list building and AI-assisted personalisation. Former top-performing SDR (6 consecutive quarters exceeding quota) who understands both the strategic and operational sides of ABM execution.

## Relevant Experience

### Founder & Managing Director
**Pump'd** | *Christchurch, New Zealand* | *2024 – Present*

Built and scaled a SaaS platform for NZ restaurants. More relevantly: designed and implemented the entire GTM infrastructure as a solo operator—list building, enrichment, automation, and AI-assisted outreach.

#### List Building & Account-Intel Automation (Clay-Equivalent Work)

- **Built reusable scraping recipes** using Firecrawl to extract structured account data from multiple sources (UberEats, DoorDash, restaurant websites, Google Business Profiles)
- **Designed multi-source enrichment workflows**: account data → contact identification → email/phone enrichment → platform presence detection → competitive intel aggregation
- **Created account-intel automation** that generates one-page briefs per prospect including: business hours, delivery platforms used, menu pricing, estimated order volumes, tech stack, social presence, and identified pain points
- **Reduced research time by 90%+**: what previously took 30-45 minutes per account now runs in under 3 minutes with automated QA checks

#### Data Infrastructure & QA

- **Built normalised database schema** (PostgreSQL/Supabase) with 80+ fields per account record including: ICP rating (0-10), lead warmth scoring, engagement source tracking, and buying-group identification
- **Implemented validation rules**: address normalisation, phone formatting, email verification, duplicate detection, and data completeness checks
- **Maintained clean change logs** and versioned data transformations for audit trails

#### LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering

- **Hands-on Claude/Anthropic API usage** for account research summarisation, pain point extraction, and personalised outreach generation
- **Built structured output pipelines**: JSON schemas for consistent data extraction from unstructured sources
- **Developed prompt libraries** for repeatable tasks: competitive analysis, objection prediction, value prop customisation by segment

#### Automation & Workflow Orchestration

- **Playwright browser automation** for multi-step workflows across platforms without APIs
- **CRON-based scheduling** for recurring data refreshes and trigger-based actions
- **CSV/CRM exports** with field mapping and format standardisation for downstream tools

#### Results

- **67% outreach-to-demo conversion** (vs. industry average ~15-20%)
- **98% reduction in manual processes** through systematic automation
- **30+ accounts onboarded** using automated list-building and enrichment pipelines

### Sales Development Representative → Account Executive (Training)
**Loaded** | *New Zealand* | *2023 – 2024*

First SDR hire at high-growth hospitality tech startup. This is where I learned to think in systems about prospecting.

- **Exceeded quota 6 consecutive quarters** while developing repeatable prospecting workflows
- **Built the "list engine"**: created targeting criteria, account scoring models, and outreach sequences that became team templates
- **Defined ICPs and buying groups** for ANZ hospitality market: identified decision-makers, influencers, and blockers by segment
- **Developed playbooks and documentation**: call scripts, objection handling frameworks, and discovery methodologies adopted by subsequent hires

## Why I'm a Fit for This Role

**"SDRs with strong ops chops who automated their desk and built repeatable list engines"** — this is literally my story.

I went from exceeding SDR quota to building the entire GTM automation stack for my own company. I've done the Clay-equivalent work (multi-source enrichment, recipe building, QA, exports) using custom tooling. I understand both sides: what strategists and SDRs need from lists, and how to build systems that deliver it reliably.

I'm already deep in LLMs for research and summarisation. I've built account-intel automations that generate prospect briefs. I obsess over data hygiene. I document everything. And I'm in APAC with full overlap for Australian business hours.
