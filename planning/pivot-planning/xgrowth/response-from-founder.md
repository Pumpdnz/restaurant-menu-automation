Hi Gianni,

Thank you for your message.

For the next step, we’d love for you to record a short 2 or 3 minute video showing us a Clay or AI project you’ve built that you’re proud of. Walk us through:

What does it do/problem that it solves?

How does it work? And what stack did you use?

Why did you make the decisions you made to build the workflow in this way?

We ask for this video for two reasons. First, to get to know you a bit better, and second, to see who’s genuinely interested in the position versus those who just clicked “apply” on LinkedIn.

You can record your video using your phone or computer, upload it to Google Drive, Dropbox, Loom, or any platform you prefer, and share the link here.

It doesn’t need to be fancy or polished, we just want to hear from you.

Thanks,
Shahin
