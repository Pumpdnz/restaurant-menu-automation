Hi,

Your job description says you're looking for "SDRs with strong ops chops who automated their desk and built repeatable list engines."

That's not just a persona I match, it's literally what I did.

I was the first SDR hire at Loaded (NZ hospitality tech startup), hit quota six quarters straight, then left to start my own company. When I realised I couldn't afford to hire someone to build lists, do account research and assist with onboarding, I built the systems myself.

I taught myself how to rapidly prototype and build production systems with Claude Code. Now I have:

- **Reusable scraping recipes** that pull structured account data from multiple sources (websites, marketplaces, directories) and enrich it with contact info, tech stack signals, and competitive intel
- **An account-intel automation system** that generates a sales brief per prospect in under 3 minutes, something that used to take me 30-45 minutes manually
- **A normalised database** with 80+ fields per account, ICP scoring, lead warmth tracking, and full QA validation
- **Onboarding automation tools** integrated with a custom-built CRM, allowing sales reps to reach out to new prospects with completely set up demo accounts, within minutes
- **67% outreach-to-demo conversion** because the data is clean and the personalisation is specific

While I‘ve only used Clay briefly, I've built the equivalent from scratch: multi-source enrichment → deduplication → validation → structured export. I'm confident I can pick up your recipes fast and start shipping improvements immediately.

**On LLMs:** I use Claude daily, both the API and Claude Code for development. I've built structured output pipelines for data extraction & transformation, onboarding automation, and personalised outreach generation. I understand prompt patterns, context engineering, and where human-in-the-loop checks need to sit alongside LLM outputs.

**On documentation:** I write SOPs, maintain runbooks, version my prompts, and keep change logs. I've learned (the hard way) that automation without documentation is technical debt.

**On timezone:** I'm in Christchurch, New Zealand. That's AEDT + 2 hours. I’ve sold into Australia from New Zealand in my previous role and with full overlap with Australian business hours, it’s no problem.

**What excites me about xGrowth:** I've been doing this work in a narrow vertical (restaurants). The idea of applying the same systematic approach across enterprise tech clients (Shopify, Twilio, Zoom) is exactly the scale and variety I'm looking for. ABM list building and account-intel automation is genuinely fun for me. I like turning messy data into clean, actionable outputs.

I'm ready to ship recipes, build automations, and contribute from day one. Happy to walk through my existing systems in a call as I know that showing is often better than telling.

Cheers,
Gianni Munro
