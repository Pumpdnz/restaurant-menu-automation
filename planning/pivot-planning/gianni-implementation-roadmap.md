# Career Transition Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the phased approach for Gianni to transition from running Pump'd full-time toward securing a GTME/AI Implementation role, while maintaining Pump'd as a case study and potential passive income source.

**Timeline:** 12-16 weeks to role secured (target)
**Fallback:** Agency launch if job search doesn't yield results by week 12

## Final Notes

### Key Mindset Reminders

1. **You have real skills.** Building a production SaaS solo while learning to code is exceptional. Own that.

2. **The hybrid is rare.** Sales quota achievement + technical building is an unusual combination. It's a strength, not a weakness.

3. **No CS degree is fine.** Many companies value demonstrated ability over credentials. Your portfolio proves capability.

4. **67% is remarkable.** That conversion rate is world-class. Lead with it.

5. **Agency is a valid path.** If job search doesn't work, agency is not "failure" - it's a different path to the same goal.

### Support Resources

- **Claude Project:** Use for ongoing support, interview prep, application review
- **LinkedIn connections:** Lean on network for referrals
- **Pump'd customers:** Potential references or connections
