## Affected React Versions

The vulnerability affects **React Server Components** in the following versions:

### Vulnerable React Versions:
- **19.0.0**
- **19.1.0**
- **19.1.1**
- **19.2.0**

### Affected Packages:
- `react-server-dom-webpack`
- `react-server-dom-parcel`
- `react-server-dom-turbopack`

### Patched React Versions:
- **19.0.1** (for 19.0.x users)
- **19.1.2** (for 19.1.x users)
- **19.2.1** (for 19.2.x users)

## Attack Vector

### How It Works:
1. The vulnerability exists in how React Server Components process HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints
2. Attackers craft malicious HTTP requests with specially formatted payloads
3. The server unsafely deserializes these payloads without proper validation
4. Attacker-controlled data influences server-side JavaScript execution
5. Results in **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on the server

### Key Characteristics:
- **Unauthenticated**: No authentication required
- **Remote**: Can be exploited over the network
- **Pre-authentication**: Executes before application authentication logic
- **Near 100% reliability**: Highly reliable exploitation
- **Default configuration vulnerable**: Standard deployments at immediate risk

## Vite-Based Applications Risk Assessment

### CRITICAL FINDING FOR OUR CODEBASE:

| Scenario | Vulnerable? |
|----------|-------------|
| Vite + React (client-side only, no RSC) | **NO** |
| Vite + React 18 or earlier | **NO** |
| Traditional SPA with Vite | **NO** |
| Vite + `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` | **YES** |
| Vite + React Server Components | **YES** |

**Key Point**: The vulnerability is specific to **React Server Components implementation**, NOT the bundler itself. If using Vite with plain React (not RSC), you are **NOT affected**.

---

## Affected Frameworks

### Next.js (Most Common Target):
- 15.0.0 through 15.5.x (unpatched)
- 16.0.0 through 16.0.6
- Various canary releases

### Other Affected:
- React Router (unstable RSC APIs)
- Waku
- Redwood SDK (rwsdk)
- Expo (with RSC)
- `@vitejs/plugin-rsc`
- `@parcel/rsc`

## Exploitation in the Wild

**Status**: Actively exploited since December 5, 2025

### Observed Activity:
- China-nexus threat groups rapidly adopted exploit
- 95 IP addresses performing automated exploitation (GreyNoise)
- Credential harvesting (AWS credentials observed)
- Malware installation (Sliver framework)
- Cryptocurrency mining (XMRig)
- Remote shell establishment

## Initial Assessment for Our Project

### Current State (from package.json):
- **React**: ^19.1.0 (resolves to 19.1.1 - POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE VERSION)
- **Vite**: ^7.1.3
- **No Next.js**

### Key Questions for Codebase Scan:
1. Do we use React Server Components?
2. Do we have `react-server-dom-*` packages installed?
3. Do we use `@vitejs/plugin-rsc`?
4. Is there any server-side rendering of React components?

**If the answer to all is NO, we are likely NOT vulnerable to this specific CVE, but should still upgrade to patched versions as a precaution.**

## Next Step

Proceed to **Step 3: Codebase Vulnerability Scan** to determine if our application uses any of the vulnerable patterns.
